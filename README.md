# Fully-Analog-Line-Following-Robot
This project was a group project completed under the module EN2091 - Laboratory Practice and Projects - Semester 3, Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa.
# Introduction
Line following is a common task in many robot applications.
But here the special case is our robot do line following using only analog electronic components.
That means no micro controllers as in common case.
